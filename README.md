It's offline :/ Sorry.

Github webhook that blocks pull requests with less than two reviews.

https://youshallnotpass.review


## How to use
1. On Github, define a protected branch on you project settings page
`url: https://github.com/<you>/<your_project/settings/branches`;

2. Mark the flag **Require status checks to pass before merging**;
3. Goes to [You Shall Not Pass](https://youshallnotpass.review) and activate the webhook for you repository.

Done :)
